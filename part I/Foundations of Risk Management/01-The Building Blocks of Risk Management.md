# The Building Blocks of Risk Management

## Ten risk management building blocks

1. The risk management process
2. Identifying risk: knowns ans unknowns
3. Expected loss, unexpected loss and tail loss
4. Risk factor breakdown
5. Structural change: from tail risk to systemic crisis
6. Human agency and conflicts of interest
7. Typology of risks and risk interactions
8. Risk aggregation
9. Balancing risk and reward
10. Enterprise risk management (ERM)

A typology of risk for banking industry

## Market Risk

Market risk arises due to the movements in market prices.

Price volatility is the engine of market risk.

Market risk is driven by the following:

1. **General market risk**: This is the risk that an asset class will fall in value, leading to fall in the value of an individual asset or portfolio.
2. **Specific market risk**: This is the risk that an individual asset will fall in value more than the general asset class.

## Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the failure of one party to fulfill its financial obligations to another party.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from risk of not having cash at the right time to pay obligations. It is used to describe two separate kinds of risk:

1. **Funding liquidity risk**: It is the risk that covers the risk that a firm cannot access enough liquid cash and assets to meet it's obligations.
2. **Market liquidity risk**: It is sometimes known as trading liquidity risk. It is the risk of a loss in asset value when markets temporarily seize up.

## Operational Risk

Operational risk can be defined as the "risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events". It includes legal risk, but excludes business, strategic and reputational risk.

## Business and Strategic Risk

Business risk lie at the heart of any business and includes all the usual worries of firms, such as customer demand, pricing decisions, supplier negotiation, and managing product innovation.

Strategic risk is distinct from business risk. It involves making large, long-term decisions about the firm's direction, often accompanied by major investments of capital, human resources and management reputation.

## Reputational Risk

Reputational risk is the danger that a firm will suffer a sudden fall in it's market standing or brand with economic consequences.

The risk management process

1. **Avoid Risk**: There are risks that can be sidestepped by discontinuing the business or pursuing it using a different strategy.
2. **Retain Risk**: There are risks that can be retained within the firm's risk appetite.
3. **Mitigate Risk**: There are risks that can be mitigated by reducing exposure, frequency and severity.
4. **Transfer Risk**: There are risks that can be transferred to a third party using derivative products, structured products, or by paying a premium(insurance).

## Identifying Risk: Known and unknowns

Risk managers face the unknown and unexpected

**Expected Loss(EL)**: is the average loss a position taker might expect to incur form a position or portfolio.

EL = Probability of Default(PD) X Loss given default(LGD) X Exposure at default(EAD)

Where EL can be calculated with confidence, it can be treated as a variable cost or predictable expense rather than risk or uncertainty. The bank can make a profit by simply adding a price margin that covers the cost of EL.

## Expect the unexpected

Well behaved portfolios inevitably offer surprises. EL is created from good and bad days. On a bad day, losses can range above the expected level. The extent to which losses depart form the average is called the unexpected loss level.

## Tail Risk

Tail risk is the risk arising from extremely rare but very severe events.

In complex systems, extremely rare events can happen over long time periods, even if the structure remains structurally stable. These risks an extreme version of unexpected loss, are difficult to find in data because there are not a lot of them.

Tail risks can be identified with long enough time series data and Extreme Value Theory(EVT).

## 3 lines of defense in risk management

1. **First Line**: Business line that generates, owns and manages risk
2. **Second Line**: Risk managers that specialize in risk management and day-to-day oversight.
3. **Third Line**: Periodic independent oversight and assurance, such as an internal audit.
